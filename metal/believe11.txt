[Verse 1]
Don't turn away
I pray you've heard the words I've spoken
Dare to believe over one last time

[Chorus]
Then I'll let the darkness cover me
Deny everything
Slowly walk away
To breathe again, on my own

[Verse 2]
Carry me away
I need your strength to get me through this
Dare to believe over one last time

[Chorus]
Then I'll let the darkness cover me
Deny everything
Slowly walk away
To breathe again, on my own
On my own, on my own
On my own, on my own

[Interlude]
Dare to believe
Over one last time

[Chorus]
Then I'll let the darkness cover me
Deny everything
Slowly walk away
To breathe again, on my own
On my own
