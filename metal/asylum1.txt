[Intro]
Release me!
Rah!

[Verse 1]
No remnants were ever found of it
Feeling the hot bile with every fake smile
Though no evidence was ever found
It never went away, completely

I try to hide from the unholy sound of it
Another day gone, another night's dawn
Dark forces pull me underground
They never went away, completely

[Pre-Chorus]
How can I feel this empty?
I will not recover, this time
This loneliness is killing me, ah!

[Verse 2]
Will I never know peace of mind, again?
I don't believe it, I can't achieve it
I think it all is just another sign
That never went away, completely

[Pre-Chorus]
Terror is coursing in me
Dreading the final moments
When I have to dream
And feel you die

[Chorus]
In asylum (I live a lie)
Don't you know I'm in love with you and I wasn't ready
For asylum (Relive a lie)
To let go, now it's dragging me into your grave

Your asylum (Forgive the lie)
Overcome by the feeling
That I won't get to join you, in time
For the loneliness is killing me, ah!

[Verse 3]
Death's images are all around, again
They're right behind me, they're going to find me
Judgment for the immortal sin
That had enveloped me, completely, ah!

I know I'll never know a peaceful night, again
Afraid they'll hear me, they don't fear me
Punishment for the immoral crime
The debt was never paid, completely

[Pre-Chorus]
Terror is coursing in me
(Death inside of me, keeps a diligent watch on everything)
Dreading the final moments
(Keeps a terrible hold on my belief)
When I have to dream
(Just waiting for the moment when I)
And feel you die

[Chorus]
In asylum (I live a lie)
Don't you know I'm in love with you and I wasn't ready
For asylum (Relive a lie)
To let go, now it's dragging me into your grave

Your asylum (Forgive the lie)
Overcome by the feeling
That I won't get to join you, in time
For the loneliness is killing me, ah!

[Bridge]
In the end, there will be no suffering (More suffering)
In the end, you will find out everything (Not anything)
In the end, you may question your belief (What belief)
In the end, you will realize someday, how you were deceived

This has gone on too long (Too long)
No more demonic dreams
Destroyer, come tonight
Because her memory is killing me

[Chorus]
In asylum (I live a lie)
I let go, now it's dragging me into your grave
For asylum (Relive the lie)
Overcome by the feeling
That I won't get to join you, in time (Without you)
This world is not fulfilling me, ah!

[Outro]
Don't think I live in asylum (I live a lie)
Don't want to live in asylum (I'll live a lie)
Don't think I live in asylum (I live a lie)
