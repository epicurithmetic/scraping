[Intro]
Go

[Verse 1]
I want to tear a big hole in what is to be
To end all this infatuation with unity
I'm seeking my salvation alone again
I never needed to be one of you anyway

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Don't want to be another player losing in this game
I'm trying to impress upon you
We're not the same
My own individuality is so unique
I'm one impressive motherfucker
Now, wouldn't you say

[Chorus]
Break apart and
Divide, divide, divide, divide
You might say that I'm the last man standing now
And though you try, you'll never find a way to break me
You might say that I'm sick of being lost in the crowd
I hear the sirens but they're never going to take me

[Verse 2]
I am a little more provocative than you might need
It is your shock and then your horror on which I feed
So can you tell me what exactly does freedom mean
If I'm not free to be as twisted as I want to be

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Don't want to be another player losing in this game
I'm trying to impress upon you
We're not the same
My psychotic mentality is so unique
I'm one aggressive motherfucker
Now, wouldn't you say

[Chorus]
Break apart and
Divide, divide, divide, divide
You might say that I'm the last man standing now
And though you try, you'll never find a way to break me
You might say that I'm sick of being lost in the crowd
I hear the sirens but they're never going to take me

[Bridge]
They won't take me
Break, break, break, break
Break apart and divide
Break, break, break, break
Break apart and divide
Break, break, break, break
Break apart and divide, divide, divide
Break apart and

[Outro]
Divide, divide, divide, divide
Divide, divide, break apart and divide
Divide, divide, divide, divide
Divide, divide, break apart and
Divide, divide, divide, divide
Divide, divide, break apart and divide
Divide, divide, divide, divide
Divide, divide, divide, divide
