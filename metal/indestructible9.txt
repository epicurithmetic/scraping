[Intro]
Malevolent criminal, I
When the vision paints my mind
Cross the invisible line
And you'll be paid in kind
Malevolent criminal, I
When the vision paints my mind
Cross the invisible line
And you'll be paid in kind

[Verse 1]
Hit it!
Criminal, the suffering
It makes me think like a
Criminal, the suffering
When we're alone
Criminal, the suffering
It makes me feel like a
Criminal, the suffering
When we're alone

[Refrain]
Typical enough for me
That I burn inside in agony
What power will enable me
To bury my vision?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
The hunger coming over me
As I learn to hide the agony
To make a final remedy
To close the door once and for all

[Chorus]
In a world that I don't want to know
With a message that I never want to send
To be free from all of this
I want you to quicken my end
Don't tell me I can not go
With a wound that refuses to mend
Deliver me from all of this
I want you to quicken my end

[Verse 2]
(It seems the whole experience is)
Terrible and crippling
The pain is much more than
Physical beyond belief
When we're alone

[Refrain]
Typical enough for me
That I burn inside in agony
What power will enable me
To make this decision?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Despair has fallen over me
No way to hide the agony
Embracing my calamity
To save myself once and for all

[Chorus]
In a world that I don't want to know
With a message that I never want to send
To be free from all of this
I want you to quicken my end
Don't tell me I can not go
With a wound that refuses to mend
Deliver me from all of this
I want you to quicken my end

[Bridge 1]
Now you want to know
You want a name
You want to call me motherfucker
Now you want to know
You want a name
You want to say it doesn't matter
Now you want to know
You want a name
You want to call me motherfucker
Now you want to know
You want a name
You want to say it doesn't matter now

[Bridge 2]
Now that you want to know
Now you want a name
Now you want a place
Now you want a time
Now you want it all
Now that you want to know
Now you want a name
Now you want a place
Now you want a time
Now you want it all
Now

[Chorus]
In a world that I don't want to know
With a message that I never want to send
To be free from all of this
I want you to quicken my end
Don't tell me I can not go
With a wound that refuses to mend
Deliver me from all of this
I want you to quicken my end

[Verse 3]
Don't say that it isn't so
I'm on a path that you'll never comprehend
Set me free from all of this
I need you to quicken my end
