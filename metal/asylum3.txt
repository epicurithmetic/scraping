[Verse 1]
I am now an instrument of violence
I am a vessel of invincibility
I cannot leave this undecided
Stepping down to battle another day

Remember me for all time
This determination is a vital part of me
Surrender now, or be counted
With the endless masses that I will defeat

[Pre-Chorus]
Come on bring it, don't sing it
Better believe it

Broken down, 'til your hope has died
Beat down, 'til the victory is mine
Stand up and show me some pride
And now, are you ready?

[Chorus]
I'm one with the warrior, inside
My dominance can't be denied
Your entire world will turn
Into a battlefield, tonight

As I look upon you
Through the warriors eyes, now
I can see the fear that will
Ensure my victory, this time

[Verse 2]
I can't be told to compromise this
They'll never doubt the body lying at my feet
A most formidable reminder
They will speak my name for eternity

I have no need of any guidance
I am a weapon, powerful beyond belief
Seen through the warriors eyes
I never need to question how to defeat you

[Pre-Chorus]
Come on bring it, don't sing it
Better believe it

Broken down, 'til your hope has died
Beat down, 'til the victory is mine
Stand up and show me some pride
And now, are you ready?

[Chorus]
I'm one with the warrior, inside
My dominance can't be denied
Your entire world will turn
Into a battlefield, tonight

As I look upon you
Through the warriors eyes, now
I can see the fear that will
Ensure my victory, this time

[Bridge]
You can't hide, now
I am the warrior
So decide, now
How they’ll remember you

Do not hide, now
Act like a warrior
Show your pride, now
Solidify your place in time

[Chorus]
I'm one with the warrior, inside
My dominance can’t be denied
Your entire world will turn
Into a battlefield, tonight

As I look upon you
Through the warriors eyes, now
I can see the fear that will
Ensure my victory, this time

I'm one with the warrior, inside
The evidence can't be denied
The entire world will stare
Into this battlefield, tonight

As I stand before you
With a warriors heart, now
I can feel the strength that will
Ensure my victory, this time
