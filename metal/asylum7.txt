[Verse 1]
When others left before
I could bear to turn away
Now that it’s come to this
Is there nothing left to say?
I’ve never known before
Such exquisite suffering
As I watched you walk away
I gave into panicking

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I can’t believe that
This is really happening
Am I really lost again?
Desperation drives me insane

[Chorus]
I will focus all my pain
Right into your heart
'til it makes you blind
'til the faces of your former world
Have fallen from your sight
'til you’re mine
Until the voice of doubt no longer
Dominates your mind
I’m crucified

[Verse 2]
Cold and unwhole again
Crying out and questioning
Will I ever love again?
What’s the point of anything?
It takes a toll again
This is where the fun begins
Visions haunt me through the night
Now I’m dying for your sins

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I can’t believe that
If you look me in the face
You can say there’s nothing left
How the silence drives me insane

[Chorus]
I will focus all my pain
Right into your heart
'til it makes you blind
'til the faces of your former world
Have fallen from your sight
'til you’re mine
Until the voice of doubt no longer
Dominates your mind
I’m crucified

[Bridge]
I cannot feel anything
Anger I've been harboring
You've nailed me to the cross
Upon it I will remain
I can’t feel anything
Rage inside is festering
You've nailed me to the cross
Upon it I will remain

[Chorus]
I will focus all my pain
Right into your heart
'til it makes you blind (Blind)
'til the faces of your former world
Have fallen from your sight
'til you’re mine (Mine)
Until the voice of doubt no longer
Dominates your mind
I’m crucified

[Verse 4]
'til it makes you blind (Blind)
'til the faces of your former world
Have fallen from your sight (I'm crucified)
'til you’re mine (Mine)
Until the voice of doubt no longer
Dominates your mind
I’m crucified
