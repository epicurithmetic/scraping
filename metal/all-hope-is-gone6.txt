[Verse 1: Corey Taylor]
Contrite, commercial
Arrogance, leprosy
Consume the bitch, the fucker
Mindless, like a child
For pity's sake, I've had all that I can take
We try, but in the end, we'll see
There are no more codes
Only who is shit and who's still free
I was gonna change the world with honor and aggression
No one listened, no one cared
All they saw was misdirection

[Chorus: Corey Taylor & Chris Fehn]
(Go ahead and disagree)
I'm giving up again
(Go ahead and disagree)
I'm giving up again
(Go ahead and disagree)
I'm giving up again
(Go ahead and disagree)
I'm giving up again

[Verse 2: Corey Taylor & Chris Fehn]
I don't want you anymore (I don't want you anymore)
I don't need you anymore (I don't need you anymore)
Fingerprint of God
Your new religions covet
This vessel wasn't built to last
But I will live forever
You'll never have to say surrender
Because you're so part of it
My total honesty has no place for tomorrow
Guilty pleasures give me pain
Tell my people I can't follow

[Chorus: Corey Taylor & Chris Fehn]
(Go ahead and disagree)
I'm giving up again
(Go ahead and disagree)
I'm giving up again
(Go ahead and disagree)
I'm giving up again
(Go ahead and disagree)
I'm giving up again

[Bridge: Corey Taylor]
You'll never censor me
You better cherish me
My reason has a voice
Freedom's gone but we'll always have a choice
My present future tense
It doesn't make much sense
I'm coming after you
Fuck you all, I'm the only point of view

[Guitar Solo: Jim Root]

[Break: Corey Taylor]
Oh, violence and dollar signs
Another processed piece of shit
You hide your fault in diamonds
And give away the only
Cost, you can't delay the inevitable
Lost, don't understand the incredible path
I'm losing ground, but I won't care when I go down

[Chorus: Corey Taylor & Chris Fehn]
(Go ahead and disagree)
I'm giving up again
(Go ahead and disagree)
I'm giving up again
(Go ahead and disagree)
I'm giving up again
(Go ahead and disagree)
I'm giving up again

[Chorus: Corey Taylor & Chris Fehn]
(Go ahead and disagree)
I'm giving up again
(Go ahead and disagree)
I'm giving up again
(Go ahead and disagree)
I'm giving up again
(Go ahead and disagree)
I'm giving up again

[Outro: Corey Taylor]
I'm giving up again
I'm giving up again
