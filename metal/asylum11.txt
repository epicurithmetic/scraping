[Intro]
Who is innocent?
No one is innocent?
Who is innocent?
Who is innocent?
No one is innocent?
Who is innocent?

[Verse 1]
Who is innocent?
Is it relevant in the world today?
I shake my head in disbelief
The killer walks again, freed by evil men
And their dark charade
This can’t be happening
A mother’s selfish pride, her child's homicide
Can she be to blame?
The suited vulture’s circling
A father’s cruelty, a murdered family
Is the world insane?
Their defenders ready to embrace their lies
With their devious smiles

[Chorus]
Your corruption is like a cancer growing inside
You owe the world an apology
You’ve been taught all your life
That truth is easy to hide
You'll face your judgment another day
And suffer eternally

[Refrain]
Who is innocent?
No one is innocent
Who is innocent?

[Verse 2]
Presumed innocent
Justice fails again in the masquerade
A battered woman trembling
Her lover drunk again
When will the torture end in her web of shame?
Is death the only way?
A child victimized, the crime politicized
For the counselor's gain
The rabid media congregates
His tortured memories
A pervert's fantasies
Is the world insane?
The parasitic devastation seen
On your TV screen

[Chorus]
Your corruption is like a cancer growing inside
You owe the world an apology
You’ve been taught all your life
That truth is easy to hide
You'll face your judgment another day
And suffer eternally

[Bridge]
False defender, burn forever
False defender, burn forever
Cold and spineless, have you no soul?
Wicked-minded, out of control
And guided by their hunger
They will find new ways to betray us

[Chorus]
Your corruption is like a cancer growing inside
You owe the world an apology
You’ve been taught all your life
That truth is easy to hide
You'll face your judgment another day
And suffer eternally

[Outro]
Who is innocent?
Is it relevant in the world today?
I shake my head in disbelief
Presumed innocent
Justice fails again
In the masquerade
Has the whole world become insane?
