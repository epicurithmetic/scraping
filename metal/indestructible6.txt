[Intro]
We don't want them, we want everything
We've told them to want everything

[Verse 1]
We don't want them, we want everything
We've stolen in this suffering
And we told them to want everything
But use caution in what you believe
And the haunted, deny everything
Controlling in this suffering
When they're broken, and lost everything
They're so much easier to lead

[Pre-Chorus]
Take their hope away
Take their life away
Leave them nothing left inside

[Chorus]
When your own have died
When there's no more pride
When your soul is frozen
Is that enough?
When your heart is broken
A thousand times
With every moment
Is that enough?

[Verse 2]
Without warning, we take everything
Without warning, we take everything
Undaunted in this suffering
Dark forces, surround everything
Make it impossible to save

[Pre-Chorus]
Take their hope away
Take their life away
We have nothing left inside

[Chorus]
When your own have died
When there's no more pride
When your soul is frozen
Is that enough?
When your heart is broken
A thousand times
With every moment
Is that enough?

[Bridge]
Haven't they suffered enough now?
Haven't we suffered enough now?
Haven't they suffered enough, they're damaged more than they can bear
Haven't they suffered enough now?
Haven't we suffered enough now?
Haven't they suffered enough, they're damaged more than I can bear

[Verse 3]
Did they even have a reason why
Countless sons and daughters had to die?
Can you even comprehend the pain?
Tell me when your

[Chorus]
Own have died
When there's no more pride
When your soul is frozen
Is that enough?
When your heart is broken
A thousand times
With every moment
Is that enough?

[Chorus/Outro]
When your own have died (Own have died)
When there's no more pride (No more pride)
When your soul is frozen
Is that enough? (Is that enough?)
When your heart is broken
A thousand times (A thousand times)
With every moment
Is that enough?
