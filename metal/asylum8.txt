[Verse 1]
See the dogs come running, smelling blood now
To an open sore on a parasite
Countless hearts have fallen, hard to number
Damnation's whore is looking for a victim, tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
With an angry soul
And a wicked design
Your will cannot endure
And your heart is torn away

[Chorus]
I was caught up in the moment
You were alone and you seemed to harness the light
Even though I felt cold, inside
When you told me it would be alright

I had given up control
And I didn't focus hard enough
To see the warning signs
Your heart is serpentine

[Verse 2]
Damn what I'm becoming, one of them now
Just an opened door on an endless night
Dark desire burning in my blood, now
How can I be sure? I don't know if I'll be able to fight

[Pre-Chorus]
With a tortured soul
And an honest design
My will cannot endure
If my heart is torn away

[Chorus]
I was caught up in the moment
You were alone and you seemed to harness the light
Even though I felt cold, inside
When you told me it would be alright

I had given up control
And I didn't focus hard enough
To see the warning signs
Your heart is serpentine

[Bridge]
Now that I've been torn apart
Will there be an end to this?
Will there finally be release?
Will I finally rest in peace?
I'm determined to believe
My prayers will be received

[Pre-Chorus]
With a tortured soul
And an honest design
My will cannot endure
As my heart is torn away

[Chorus]
I was caught up in the moment
You were alone and you seemed to harness the light
Even though I felt cold, inside
When you told me it would be alright

I had given up control
And I didn't focus hard enough
To see the warning signs
Your heart is serpentine

[Outro]
The warning signs
Your heart is serpentine
Evil personified
Your heart is serpentine
