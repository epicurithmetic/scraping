[Verse 1]
Spineless from the start, sucked into the part
Circus comes to town, you play the lead clown

[Pre-Chorus]
Please, please, spreading his disease
Living by his story
Knees, knees, falling to your knees
Suffer for his glory, you will

[Chorus]
Time for lust, time for lie
Time to kiss your life goodbye
Send me money, send me green, heaven you will meet
Make a contribution and you'll get a better seat
Bow to leper messiah

[Verse 2]
Marvel at his tricks, need your Sunday fix
Blind devotion came, rotting your brain

[Pre-Chorus]
Chain, chain, join the endless chain
Taken by his glamour
Fame, Fame, infection is the game
Stinking drunk with power, we see

[Chorus]
Time for lust, time for lie
Time to kiss your life goodbye
Send me money, send me green, heaven you will meet
Make a contribution and you'll get a better seat
Bow to leper messiah

[Bridge]
Witchery, weakening
Sees the sheep are gathering
Set the trap, hypnotize
Now you follow

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
Time for lust, time for lie
Time to kiss your life goodbye
Send me money, send me green
Heaven you will meet
Make a contribution and you'll get a better seat
Lie, lie, lie, lie
Lie, lie, lie, lie!
