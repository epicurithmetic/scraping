[Verse 1]
What has come over me
What madness taken hold of my heart
To run away, the only answer
Pulling me away
To fall upon (the night)
The source of my recovery
Sweet shadow taking hold of the light
Another day has been devoured
Calling me away, begging the question
Why?

[Pre-Chorus]
For saving me from all they've taken
Letting my armor fall again
Giving me the strength to face them
Feeling it taking over now
On a path to take it all away
There can be no better way of knowing

[Chorus]
In a world beyond controlling
Are you going to deny the savior
In front of your eyes?
Stare into the night
Power beyond containing
Are you going to remain a slave for
The rest of your life?
Give into the night

[Verse 2]
This self discovery
Redemption taking hold of my mind
A serenade of haunting voices
Calling me away
To feast upon (the night)
The source of my felicity
Dark maiden taking hold of my hand
Lead me away from hibernation
Strong and unafraid
Never a question why

[Pre-Chorus]
For saving me from all they've taken
Letting my armor fall again
Giving me the strength to face them
Feeling it taking over now
On a path to take it all away
There can be no better way of knowing

[Chorus]
In a world beyond controlling
Are you going to deny the savior
In front of your eyes?
Stare into the night
Power beyond containing
Are you going to remain a slave for
The rest of your life?
Give into the night

[Hook]
Give in to the night

[Chorus]
In a world beyond controlling
Are you going to deny the savior
In front of your eyes?
Stare into the night
Power beyond containing
Are you going to remain a slave for
The rest of your life?
Give into the night

[Outro]
Night, night, night
Give into the night
Night, night, night
Give into the night
Give into the night
