[Verse 1]
Go on and wring my neck
Like when a rag gets wet
A little discipline
For my pet genius
My head is like lettuce
Go on dig your thumbs in
I cannot stop giving
I'm thirty-something

[Chorus 1]
Sense of security
Like pockets jingling
Midlife crisis
Suck ingenuity
Down through the family tree

[Chorus 2]
You're perfect yes, it's true
But without me you're only you (You're only you)
Your menstruating heart
It ain't bleeding enough for two

[Chorus 3]
It's a midlife crisis... [x2]

[Verse 2]
What an inheritance
The salt and the kleenex
Morbid self attention
Bending my pinky back
A little discipline
A donor by habit
A little discipline
Rent an opinion

[Chorus 1]
Sense of security
Holding blunt instrument
Midlife crisis
I'm a perfectionist
And perfect is a skinned knee

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 3]

[Chorus 2] [x2]

Go on and wring my neck
Go on and wring my neck
Like when a rag gets wet
Go on and wring my neck
