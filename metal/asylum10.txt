[Verse 1]
I will forever be reminded
Of how I struggled to survive
The betrayal that you conspired in
All that devotion thrown away
And with everything I confided
I should have known not to trust again
This insanity has divided
Left me with nothing left to destroy
I'm becoming so paranoid
Everyone is so paranoid

[Pre-Chorus]
In a moment
You will see my other side
When I'm confronted
My demeanor turns from Jekyll into Hyde

[Chorus]
Hell has broken free tonight
No pale deception anymore
You awoke him, now he will feed on the lies
He demands your sacrifice

[Verse 2]
I can barely control this feeling
Look at the murder in my eyes
I was never good at concealing
Violent thoughts have come to life
Horror will have a deeper meaning
You are the reason this began
Even now I can hear you screaming
There's only one thing left to destroy
And I'll no longer be paranoid
No more reason to be annoyed

[Pre-Chorus]
In a moment
You will see my other side
When I'm confronted
My demeanor turns from Jekyll into Hyde

[Chorus]
Hell has broken free tonight
No pale deception anymore
You awoke him, now he will feed on the lies
He demands your sacrifice

[Refrain]
Hell has broken free tonight
No pale deception anymore
You awoke him, now he will feed on the lies

[Outro/Chorus]
Hell has broken free tonight
No pale reflection anymore
You awoke him, now he will feed on the lies
He demands your sacrifice
