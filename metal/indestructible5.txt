[Verse 1]
You're broken, so am I
I'm better off alone
No one to turn to and nothing to call my own
Outspoken, so am I
Explosive words that your world wouldn't understand
Turn away again
You're beaten, so am I
I've got a heart of stone
No medication can cure what has taken hold
You're hurting, so will I
When I awake and remember why I've been running from your

[Chorus]
World
Dishonored by your world
Your world
I'm haunted by your world

[Verse 2]
My blood is cold as ice
Or so I have been told
Show no emotion, and it can destroy your soul
Another sacrifice
To a tormentor your world wouldn't understand
Turn away again
You're angered, so am I
A thousand fires burn
A land of darkness from which I cannot return
You're aching, so will I
When I awake and discover that I have been damaged by your

[Chorus]
World
Dishonored by your world
Your world
I'm haunted by your world

[Bridge]
Never will I be welcomed
Amongst the heartless monsters you surround yourself with
Feeding off the pain and misfortune of others
A maniacal breed of sub-human parasites
Grown into a feeding frenzy with the smell of fresh blood
Open your eyes and see the creatures for what they are
A swirling mass of hatred and envy
Don't be naive enough to think you're unaffected
The conversion has already begun

[Verse 3]
You're frightened, so am I
A world of demons wait
Watching the movements and filling my heart with hate
You're burning, so will I
When I awake to discover how I have been ravaged by your

[Chorus/Outro]
World (Ravaged by your world)
Dishonored by your world (Dishonored by your world)
Your world (I'm haunted by your world)
I'm haunted by your world
