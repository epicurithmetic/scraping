### Daily Updates

One thing I miss about Facebook is the newsfeed: all of the things I want to be updated about it one convenient location. So I have written some code of my own which presents all of the latest information from the websites I am interested in. In order to do this, I scrape information from: Quanta Magazine, Bandcamp, OrbMag, blogs, and news websites. This repository contains the code I use to get the information for my daily updates. Bonus: this is ad free!
 
### Scraping data from genius.com

As part of a project for a data science/linguistics course (DIGI405) at the University of Canterbury, I had to build a corpus of text to analyse using the methods taught in the class: these methods come under the heading "Corpus Linguistics".

My (dream) project would have me analyse: key topics of single artists; key topics of genres; and also try to uncover some differences in the use of language between arists and between genres. Of particular interest to me are the linguistic styles of: Bob Dylan (Folk), Oddisee (Rap), and Disturbed (Metal).

In order to do this project I need to gather vast amounts of lyrics from a wide variety of artists across different genres of music. 
 
At the moment this repository is *unedited/unoptimized stream-of-consciousness* code.
