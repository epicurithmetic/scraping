As part of a project for a data science/linguistics course (DIGI405) at the University of Canterbury, I had to build a corpus of text to analyse using the methods taught in the class: these methods come under the heading "Corpus Linguistics".

My (dream) project would have me analyse: key topics of single artists; key topics of genres; and also try to uncover some differences in the use of language between arists and between genres. Of particular interest to me are the linguistic styles of: Bob Dylan (Folk), Oddisee (Rap), and Disturbed (Metal).

In order to do this project I need to gather vast amounts of lyrics from a wide variety of artists across different genres of music. 
 
At the moment this repository is *unedited/unoptimized stream-of-consciousness* code.
