### Scraping for data on genius.com 

As part of a project for a linguistics course (DIGI405) at the University of Canterbury I had to build a corpus of text to analyse using the methods taught in the class: these methods come under the heading "Corpus Linguistics".

My (dream) project would have me analyse: key topics of single artists; key topics of genres; and also try to uncover some differences in the use of language between arists and between genres. 
 
At the moment this repository is *unedited/unoptimized stream-of-consciousness* code.

#### What is in this repository? 

This repository contains the code (that I am continuing to work on) for scraping the website genius.com for lyrics. Broadly speaking, once given an artist name and album, the code can (or will be able to) save a .txt file with the lyrics of the song.
